## Restricted Boltzmann Machine

The application is about predicting handwritten digits of the MNIST Dataset, using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine that will extract and learn different features that differentiate digits, and a Logistic Regression Classifier to be trained on these learned features.

The model is fineâ€‘tuned by using Grid Search to boost the results by trying multiple values of some specific parameters and choose the best within them to base the model on them.

This application trained with BernoulliRBM and LogisticRegression give 95,39% as accuracy
